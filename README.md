# Book platform

This is a boilerplate for projects using [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with some common libraries already setup. The idea is to clone it and start programming instead of starting a new project and going trough all the configurations every time.

## Tools used in the project

- [React.JS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Project instructions

To run the project locally after cloning the repository you can use the following comands:

### `yarn install`

Will install all the dependencies of the project

### `yarn start`

Will start the project on the [browser](http://localhost:3000)

### `yarn cypress`

Will open the test suite, you must have the project running locally to run the tests.
